# TODO

- Coming soon features:
  - Remote installation and configuration of the gateway
  - Add support for logging to Enkrypt
  - Add support for remote mcp config management with CRUD APIs
  - Integrate with Enkrypt Auth server to map user API Key to MCP Gateway Key
  - Enkrypt App MCP UI and Dashboards


- Testing pending:
  - Test async input guardrails
  - Test linux installation and setup
  - Test with external cache server config


- Development pending:
  - Add --dry-run option to install command to print the mcp config. This is useful for custom mcp clients


- Nice to have:
  - Refactor enkrypt_secure_call_tools to decouple tool call logic and move to client.py
  - Async output guardrails support


- Bugs to fix:
  - Find out why sys.stdout is not working for some reason with JSON parsing issues even when printing normal strings. Search for `# TODO: Fix error and use stdout` in code
  - Fix ingress issue for remote server. See `NOTE: Ingress is not working at the moment. Please use locally or port-forward 8000 for now` in README.md
